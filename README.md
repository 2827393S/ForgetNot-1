ForgetNot is a calendar web app that allows users to plan and view their daily, weekly or monthly schedules. Users can add new events through a button or by simply double clicking the day they want to plan for. These events can be edited or deleted by users at any point as we understand not everything always goes to plan! Events may also be categorised through the application of labels. ForgetNot provides default labels along with the ability to create your own. This feature adds colour to our usersâ€™ calendars and ensures they can quickly know the type of an event. Users also benefit from an invite feature where other users or guests can join a planned event. Those who accept can then be viewed as attendees in the event description. Overall, ForgetNot offers a simple, user-friendly interface to plan your personal, work or social lives. All in one place.
